# 配置参考

本文档是 Klipper 配置文件中可用配置分段的参考。

本文档中的描述已经格式化，以便可以将它们剪切并粘贴到打印机配置文件中。 见 [installation document](Installation.md) 有关设置 Klipper 和选择初始配置文件的信息。

## 微控制器配置

### 微控制器引脚名字的格式

许多配置选项需要微控制器引脚的名称。Klipper 使用了这些引脚的硬件名称 - 例如`PA4`。

在 引脚名称前加 `!`来表示相反的电极极性（ 例如触发条件时低电平而不是高电平）。

在引脚名称前面加 `^` ，以指示该引脚启用硬件上拉电阻。如果微控制器支持下拉电阻器，那么输入引脚也可以在前面加上`~`。

注意，某些配置部分可能会“创建”额外的引脚。 如果发生这种情况，定义引脚的配置部分必须在使用这些引脚的任何部分之前列在配置文件中。

### [MCU]

主微控制器的配置。

```
[mcu]
serial:
#   The serial port to connect to the MCU. If unsure (or if it
#   changes) see the "Where's my serial port?" section of the FAQ.
#   This parameter must be provided when using a serial port.
#baud: 250000
#   The baud rate to use. The default is 250000.
#canbus_uuid:
#   If using a device connected to a CAN bus then this sets the unique
#   chip identifier to connect to. This value must be provided when using
#   CAN bus for communication.
#canbus_interface:
#   If using a device connected to a CAN bus then this sets the CAN
#   network interface to use. The default is 'can0'.
#restart_method:
#   This controls the mechanism the host will use to reset the
#   micro-controller. The choices are 'arduino', 'cheetah', 'rpi_usb',
#   and 'command'. The 'arduino' method (toggle DTR) is common on
#   Arduino boards and clones. The 'cheetah' method is a special
#   method needed for some Fysetc Cheetah boards. The 'rpi_usb' method
#   is useful on Raspberry Pi boards with micro-controllers powered
#   over USB - it briefly disables power to all USB ports to
#   accomplish a micro-controller reset. The 'command' method involves
#   sending a Klipper command to the micro-controller so that it can
#   reset itself. The default is 'arduino' if the micro-controller
#   communicates over a serial port, 'command' otherwise.
```

### 额外的mcu [mcu my_extra_mcu]

额外的微控制器（可以定义任意数量的带有“mcu”前缀的部分）。 额外的微控制器引入了额外的引脚，这些引脚可以配置为加热器、步进器、风扇等。例如，如果引入了“[mcu extra_mcu]”部分，那么诸如“extra_mcu:ar9”之类的引脚就可以在其他地方使用 ，在配置中（其中“ar9”是给定 mcu 上的硬件引脚名称或别名）。

```
[mcu my_extra_mcu]
#   请参阅"mcu"分段的配置参数。
```

## 常用的运动学设置

### [printer]

打印机控制的高级设置部分。

```
[printer]
kinematics:
#   The type of printer in use. This option may be one of: cartesian,
#   corexy, corexz, hybrid_corexy, hybrid_corexz, rotary_delta, delta,
#   polar, winch, or none. This
#   parameter must be specified.
max_velocity:
#   Maximum velocity (in mm/s) of the toolhead (relative to the
#   print). This parameter must be specified.
max_accel:
#   Maximum acceleration (in mm/s^2) of the toolhead (relative to the
#   print). This parameter must be specified.
#max_accel_to_decel:
#   A pseudo acceleration (in mm/s^2) controlling how fast the
#   toolhead may go from acceleration to deceleration. It is used to
#   reduce the top speed of short zig-zag moves (and thus reduce
#   printer vibration from these moves). The default is half of
#   max_accel.
#square_corner_velocity: 5.0
#   The maximum velocity (in mm/s) that the toolhead may travel a 90
#   degree corner at. A non-zero value can reduce changes in extruder
#   flow rates by enabling instantaneous velocity changes of the
#   toolhead during cornering. This value configures the internal
#   centripetal velocity cornering algorithm; corners with angles
#   larger than 90 degrees will have a higher cornering velocity while
#   corners with angles less than 90 degrees will have a lower
#   cornering velocity. If this is set to zero then the toolhead will
#   decelerate to zero at each corner. The default is 5mm/s.
```

### [stepper]

步进电机定义。 不同的打印机类型（由 [打印] 配置部分中的“运动学”选项指定）步进器需要定义不同的名称（例如，`stepper_x` 与 `stepper_a`）。 以下是常见的步进器定义。

See the [rotation distance document](Rotation_Distance.md) for information on calculating the `rotation_distance` parameter. See the [Multi-MCU homing](Multi_MCU_Homing.md) document for information on homing using multiple micro-controllers.

```
[stepper_x]
step_pin:
#   Step GPIO pin (triggered high). This parameter must be provided.
dir_pin:
#   Direction GPIO pin (high indicates positive direction). This
#   parameter must be provided.
enable_pin:
#   Enable pin (default is enable high; use ! to indicate enable
#   low). If this parameter is not provided then the stepper motor
#   driver must always be enabled.
rotation_distance:
#   Distance (in mm) that the axis travels with one full rotation of
#   the stepper motor (or final gear if gear_ratio is specified).
#   This parameter must be provided.
microsteps:
#   The number of microsteps the stepper motor driver uses. This
#   parameter must be provided.
#full_steps_per_rotation: 200
#   The number of full steps for one rotation of the stepper motor.
#   Set this to 200 for a 1.8 degree stepper motor or set to 400 for a
#   0.9 degree motor. The default is 200.
#gear_ratio:
#   The gear ratio if the stepper motor is connected to the axis via a
#   gearbox. For example, one may specify "5:1" if a 5 to 1 gearbox is
#   in use. If the axis has multiple gearboxes one may specify a comma
#   separated list of gear ratios (for example, "57:11, 2:1"). If a
#   gear_ratio is specified then rotation_distance specifies the
#   distance the axis travels for one full rotation of the final gear.
#   The default is to not use a gear ratio.
#step_pulse_duration:
#   The minimum time between the step pulse signal edge and the
#   following "unstep" signal edge. This is also used to set the
#   minimum time between a step pulse and a direction change signal.
#   The default is 0.000000100 (100ns) for TMC steppers that are
#   configured in UART or SPI mode, and the default is 0.000002 (which
#   is 2us) for all other steppers.
endstop_pin:
#   Endstop switch detection pin. If this endstop pin is on a
#   different mcu than the stepper motor then it enables "multi-mcu
#   homing". This parameter must be provided for the X, Y, and Z
#   steppers on cartesian style printers.
#position_min: 0
#   Minimum valid distance (in mm) the user may command the stepper to
#   move to.  The default is 0mm.
position_endstop:
#   Location of the endstop (in mm). This parameter must be provided
#   for the X, Y, and Z steppers on cartesian style printers.
position_max:
#   Maximum valid distance (in mm) the user may command the stepper to
#   move to. This parameter must be provided for the X, Y, and Z
#   steppers on cartesian style printers.
#homing_speed: 5.0
#   Maximum velocity (in mm/s) of the stepper when homing. The default
#   is 5mm/s.
#homing_retract_dist: 5.0
#   Distance to backoff (in mm) before homing a second time during
#   homing. Set this to zero to disable the second home. The default
#   is 5mm.
#homing_retract_speed:
#   Speed to use on the retract move after homing in case this should
#   be different from the homing speed, which is the default for this
#   parameter
#second_homing_speed:
#   Velocity (in mm/s) of the stepper when performing the second home.
#   The default is homing_speed/2.
#homing_positive_dir:
#   If true, homing will cause the stepper to move in a positive
#   direction (away from zero); if false, home towards zero. It is
#   better to use the default than to specify this parameter. The
#   default is true if position_endstop is near position_max and false
#   if near position_min.
```

#   max_velocity for max_z_velocity.
#max_z_accel:
#   This sets the maximum acceleration (in mm/s^2) of movement along

#   with an XY offset then choose a radius small enough so that the
#   probe always fits over the bed. This parameter must be provided.
#speed: 50
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration.
#   The default is 50.

## 打印床调平支持

### [bed_mesh]

网床调平。定义一个 bed_mesh 配置分段来启用基于探测点生成网格的 Z 轴偏移移动变换。当使用探针归位 Z 轴时，建议通过 printer.cfg 中定义一个 safe_z_home 分段使 Z 轴归位在打印区域的中心执行。

See the [bed mesh guide](Bed_Mesh.md) and [command reference](G-Codes.md#bed_mesh) for additional information.

可视化示例：

```
 rectangular bed, probe_count = 3, 3:
             x---x---x (max_point)
             |
             x---x---x
                     |
 (min_point) x---x---x

 round bed, round_probe_count = 5, bed_radius = r:
                 x (0, r) end
               /

```

```
[bed_mesh]
#speed: 50
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration.
#   The default is 50.
#horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
#mesh_radius:
#   Defines the radius of the mesh to probe for round beds. Note that
#   the radius is relative to the coordinate specified by the
#   mesh_origin option. This parameter must be provided for round beds
#   and omitted for rectangular beds.
#mesh_origin:
#   Defines the center X, Y coordinate of the mesh for round beds. This
#   coordinate is relative to the probe's location. It may be useful
#   to adjust the mesh_origin in an effort to maximize the size of the
#   mesh radius. Default is 0, 0. This parameter must be omitted for
#   rectangular beds.
#mesh_min:
#   Defines the minimum X, Y coordinate of the mesh for rectangular
#   beds. This coordinate is relative to the probe's location. This
#   will be the first point probed, nearest to the origin. This
#   parameter must be provided for rectangular beds.
#mesh_max:
#   Defines the maximum X, Y coordinate of the mesh for rectangular
#   beds. Adheres to the same principle as mesh_min, however this will
#   be the furthest point probed from the bed's origin. This parameter
#   must be provided for rectangular beds.
#probe_count: 3, 3
#   For rectangular beds, this is a comma separate pair of integer
#   values X, Y defining the number of points to probe along each
#   axis. A single value is also valid, in which case that value will
#   be applied to both axes. Default is 3, 3.
#round_probe_count: 5
#   For round beds, this integer value defines the maximum number of
#   points to probe along each axis. This value must be an odd number.
#   Default is 5.
#fade_start: 1.0
#   The gcode z position in which to start phasing out z-adjustment
#   when fade is enabled. Default is 1.0.
#fade_end: 0.0
#   The gcode z position in which phasing out completes. When set to a
#   value below fade_start, fade is disabled. It should be noted that
#   fade may add unwanted scaling along the z-axis of a print. If a
#   user wishes to enable fade, a value of 10.0 is recommended.
#   Default is 0.0, which disables fade.
#fade_target:
#   The z position in which fade should converge. When this value is
#   set to a non-zero value it must be within the range of z-values in
#   the mesh. Users that wish to converge to the z homing position
#   should set this to 0. Default is the average z value of the mesh.
#split_delta_z: .025
#   The amount of Z difference (in mm) along a move that will trigger
#   a split. Default is .025.
#move_check_distance: 5.0
#   The distance (in mm) along a move to check for split_delta_z.
#   This is also the minimum length that a move can be split. Default
#   is 5.0.
#mesh_pps: 2, 2
#   A comma separated pair of integers X, Y defining the number of
#   points per segment to interpolate in the mesh along each axis. A
#   "segment" can be defined as the space between each probed point.
#   The user may enter a single value which will be applied to both
#   axes. Default is 2, 2.
#algorithm: lagrange
#   The interpolation algorithm to use. May be either "lagrange" or
#   "bicubic". This option will not affect 3x3 grids, which are forced
#   to use lagrange sampling. Default is lagrange.
#bicubic_tension: .2
#   When using the bicubic algorithm the tension parameter above may
#   be applied to change the amount of slope interpolated. Larger
#   numbers will increase the amount of slope, which results in more
#   curvature in the mesh. Default is .2.
#relative_reference_index:
#   A point index in the mesh to reference all z values to. Enabling
#   this parameter produces a mesh relative to the probed z position
#   at the provided index.
#faulty_region_1_min:
#faulty_region_1_max:
#   Optional points that define a faulty region.  See docs/Bed_Mesh.md
#   for details on faulty regions.  Up to 99 faulty regions may be added.
#   By default no faulty regions are set.
```

### [bed_tilt]

See the [leveling guide](Manual_Level.md#adjusting-bed-leveling-screws-using-the-bed-probe) and [command reference](G-Codes.md#screws_tilt_adjust) for additional information.

```
[screws_tilt_adjust]
#screw1:
#   The (X, Y) coordinate of the first bed leveling screw. This is a
#   position to command the nozzle to that is directly above the bed
#   screw (or as close as possible while still being above the bed).
#   This is the base screw used in calculations. This parameter must
#   be provided.

```

### [z_tilt]

Multiple Z stepper tilt adjustment. This feature enables independent adjustment of multiple z steppers (see the "stepper_z1" section) to adjust for tilt. If this section is present then a Z_TILT_ADJUST extended [G-Code command](G-Codes.md#z_tilt) becomes available.

```
[z_tilt]
#z_positions:
#   A list of X, Y coordinates (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) describing the location of each bed "pivot point". The
#   "pivot point" is the point where the bed attaches to the given Z
#   stepper. It is described using nozzle coordinates (the X, Y position
#   of the nozzle if it could move directly above the point). The
#   first entry corresponds to stepper_z, the second to stepper_z1,
#   the third to stepper_z2, etc. This parameter must be provided.
#points:
#   A list of X, Y coordinates (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) that should be probed during a Z_TILT_ADJUST command.
#   Specify coordinates of the nozzle and be sure the probe is above
#   the bed at the given nozzle coordinates. This parameter must be
#   provided.
#speed: 50
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration.
#   The default is 50.
#horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
#retries: 0
#   Number of times to retry if the probed points aren't within
#   tolerance.
#retry_tolerance: 0
#   If retries are enabled then retry if largest and smallest probed
#   points differ more than retry_tolerance. Note the smallest unit of
#   change here would be a single step. However if you are probing
#   more points than steppers then you will likely have a fixed
#   minimum value for the range of probed points which you can learn
#   by observing command output.
```

### [quad_gantry_level]

Moving gantry leveling using 4 independently controlled Z motors. Corrects hyperbolic parabola effects (potato chip) on moving gantry which is more flexible. WARNING: Using this on a moving bed may lead to undesirable results. If this section is present then a QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL extended G-Code command becomes available. This routine assumes the following Z motor configuration:

```
 ----------------
 |Z1          Z2|
 |  ---------   |
 |  |       |   |
 |  |       |   |
 |  x--------   |
 |Z           Z3|
 ----------------
```

Where x is the 0, 0 point on the bed

```
[quad_gantry_level]
#gantry_corners:
#   A newline separated list of X, Y coordinates describing the two
#   opposing corners of the gantry. The first entry corresponds to Z,
#   the second to Z2. This parameter must be provided.
#points:
#   A newline separated list of four X, Y points that should be probed
#   during a QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL command. Order of the locations is
#   important, and should correspond to Z, Z1, Z2, and Z3 location in
#   order. This parameter must be provided. For maximum accuracy,
#   ensure your probe offsets are configured.
#speed: 50
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration.
#   The default is 50.
#horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
#max_adjust: 4
#   Safety limit if an adjustment greater than this value is requested
#   quad_gantry_level will abort.
#retries: 0
#   Number of times to retry if the probed points aren't within
#   tolerance.
#retry_tolerance: 0
#   If retries are enabled then retry if largest and smallest probed
#   points differ more than retry_tolerance.
```

### [skew_correction]

Printer Skew Correction. It is possible to use software to correct printer skew across 3 planes, xy, xz, yz. This is done by printing a calibration model along a plane and measuring three lengths. Due to the nature of skew correction these lengths are set via gcode. See [Skew Correction](Skew_Correction.md) and [Command Reference](G-Codes.md#skew_correction) for details.

```
[skew_correction]
```

## 自定义归零

### [safe_z_home]

Safe Z homing. One may use this mechanism to home the Z axis at a specific X, Y coordinate. This is useful if the toolhead, for example has to move to the center of the bed before Z can be homed.

```
[safe_z_home]
home_xy_position:
#   A X, Y coordinate (e.g. 100, 100) where the Z homing should be
#   performed. This parameter must be provided.
#speed: 50.0
#   Speed at which the toolhead is moved to the safe Z home
#   coordinate. The default is 50 mm/s
#z_hop:
#   Distance (in mm) to lift the Z axis prior to homing. This is
#   applied to any homing command, even if it doesn't home the Z axis.
#   If the Z axis is already homed and the current Z position is less
#   than z_hop, then this will lift the head to a height of z_hop. If
#   the Z axis is not already homed the head is lifted by z_hop.
#   The default is to not implement Z hop.
#z_hop_speed: 20.0
#   Speed (in mm/s) at which the Z axis is lifted prior to homing. The
#   default is 20mm/s.
#move_to_previous: False
#   When set to True, the X and Y axes are reset to their previous
#   positions after Z axis homing. The default is False.
```

### [homing_override]

归位覆写。可以使用这种机制来运行一系列 G-Code 命令来替代常规的G28。通常用于需要特定过程才能将机器归零的打印机。

```
[homing_override]
gcode：
#   覆盖常规 G28 命令的 G 代码命令序列。
#   G 代码格式请参阅 docs/Command_Templates.md。如果
#   G28 包含在此命令列表中，常规版本的G28会被调用并进
#   行打印机的正常归位过程。此处列出的命令必须归位所
#   有轴。
#   必须提供此参数。
#axes: xyz
#   要覆盖的轴。例如，如果将其设置为"z"，则覆盖脚本将
#   仅在 z 轴被归位时运行（例如，通过"G28" 或 "G28 Z0"
#   命令）。请注意，覆盖脚本仍然需要归位所有轴。
#   默认值为"xyz"，覆盖全部所有 G28 命令。
#set_position_x：
#set_position_y：
#set_position_z：
#   如果指定，打印机将假定轴在运行上述 G 代码命令序列
#   之前的位置。该设置会禁用相应轴的归位检查。在打印
#   头必须在执行常规 G28 机制前移动相应的轴时有用。
#   默认不假定轴的位置。
```

### [endstop_phase]

Stepper phase adjusted endstops. To use this feature, define a config section with an "endstop_phase" prefix followed by the name of the corresponding stepper config section (for example, "[endstop_phase stepper_z]"). This feature can improve the accuracy of endstop switches. Add a bare "[endstop_phase]" declaration to enable the ENDSTOP_PHASE_CALIBRATE command.

See the [endstop phases guide](Endstop_Phase.md) and [command reference](G-Codes.md#endstop_phase) for additional information.

```
[endstop_phase stepper_z]
#endstop_accuracy:
#   设置预期的限位精度（以毫米(mm)为单位）。 代表了相位可能
#   触发的最大误差距离（比如，一个可能会提早 100um 触发或延迟
#   100um 触发的限位需要将该值设为 0.200,也就是 200um）。
#  默认为 4*rotation_distance/full_steps_per_rotation。
#trigger_phase:
#   该参数定义了相位触发时预期的步进电机驱动相位。这通常是两
#   个由正斜杠符号分隔的整数 - 相位和总相位数（例如 "7/64"）。
#   只有当步进电机驱动在 mcu 重置时也会重置才需要该参数。
#   如果没有定义，步进相位会在第一次归位时检测并被用于后续归位。
#endstop_align_zero: False
#   如果是 True 则打印机的 position_endstop 相应轴的零点位置是步进
#   电机的一个全步位置。(在Z轴上，如果打印层高是全步的倍数，每
#   层都会在全步上。）
#   默认为 False。
```

## G 代码宏和事件

#   docs/Command_Templates.md 了解支持的 G 代码格式。
#   必须提供此参数。
#variable_<名称>:
#   可以指定任意数量的带有"变量_"前缀的设置。
#   定义的变量名将被赋予给定的值（并被解析为作为一个

#   例如，一个带有"variable_fan_speed = 75"的 G-Code 命令的
#   G 代码列表中可以包含"M106 S{ fan_speed * 255 }"。变量
#   可以在运行时使用 SET_GCODE_VARIABLE 命令进行修改
#   （详见docs/Command_Templates.md）。变量名称
#   不能使用大写字母。
#rename_existing:
#   这个选项将导致宏覆盖一个现有的 G-Code 命令，并通过
#   这里提供的名称引用该命令的先前定义。覆盖命令时应注
#   意，因为它可能会导致复杂和意外的错误。
#   默认不覆盖现有的 G-Code 命令。
#description: G-Code macro
#   在 HELP 命令或自动完成中使用的简单描述。
#   默认为"G-Code macro"。

#   docs/Command_Templates.md。
#   默认运行 "TURN_OFF_HEATERS" 和 "M84"。
#timeout: 600
#   在执行以上 G-Code 前等待的空闲时间（以秒为单位）
#   默认为 600 秒。
```

## 可选的 G-Code 特性

### [virtual_sdcard]

如果主机的速度不足以很好地运行 OctoPrint，虚拟 SD 卡可能有帮助。它允许 Klipper 主机软件使用标准的 SD 卡G代码命令（例如，M24）直接打印存储在主机目录中的 gcode 文件。

```
[virtual_sdcard]
path:
#   The path of the local directory on the host machine to look for
#   g-code files. This is a read-only directory (sdcard file writes
#   are not supported). One may point this to OctoPrint's upload
#   directory (generally ~/.octoprint/uploads/ ). This parameter must
#   be provided.
```

### [sdcard_loop]

Some printers with stage-clearing features, such as a part ejector or a belt printer, can find use in looping sections of the sdcard file. (For example, to print the same part over and over, or repeat the a section of a part for a chain or other repeated pattern).

See the [command reference](G-Codes.md#sdcard_loop) for supported commands. See the [sample-macros.cfg](../config/sample-macros.cfg) file for a Marlin compatible M808 G-Code macro.

```
[sdcard_loop]
```

### [force_move]

#   默认为50.0 mm/s。
```

### [firmware_retraction]

Firmware filament retraction. This enables G10 (retract) and G11 (unretract) GCODE commands issued by many slicers. The parameters below provide startup defaults, although the values can be adjusted via the SET_RETRACTION [command](G-Codes.md#firmware_retraction)), allowing per-filament settings and runtime tuning.

```
[firmware_retraction]
#retract_length: 0
#   当 G10 被运行时回抽的长度（以毫米(mm)为单位）
#   和当 G11 被运行时退回的长度（但同时也包括
#   以下的unretract_extra_length）。
#   默认为0毫米。
#retract_speed: 20
#   回抽速度，以毫米每秒(mm/s)为单位。默认为每秒20毫米。
#unretract_extra_length: 0
#   退回时增加*额外*长度（以毫米(mm)为单位）的耗材。
#unretract_speed: 10
#   退回速度，以毫米(mm)为单位。
#   默认为每秒10毫米
```

### [gcode_arcs]

Support for gcode arc (G2/G3) commands.

```
[gcode_arcs]
#resolution: 1.0
#   一条弧线将被分割成若干段。每段的长度将
#   等于上面设置的分辨率（mm）。更低的值会产生一个
#   更细腻的弧线，但也会需要机器进行更多运算。小于
#   配置值的曲线会被视为直线。
#   默认为1毫米。
```

### [respond]

Enable the "M118" and "RESPOND" extended [commands](G-Codes.md#respond).

```
[respond]
#default_type: echo
#   Sets the default prefix of the "M118" and "RESPOND" output to one
#   of the following:
#       echo: "echo: " (This is the default)
#       command: "// "
#       error: "!! "
#default_prefix: echo:
#   Directly sets the default prefix. If present, this value will
#   override the "default_type".
```

## 共振补偿

### [input_shaper]

Enables [resonance compensation](Resonance_Compensation.md). Also see the [command reference](G-Codes.md#input_shaper).

```
[input_shaper]
#shaper_freq_x: 0
#   输入整形器的 X 轴频率(Hz)。通常这是希望被输入整形器消除的
#   X 轴共振频率。对于更复杂的整形器，例如2- 和 3-hump EI 输入
#   整形器，设置这个参数可能需要考虑其他特性。
#   默认值是0，禁用 X 轴输入整形。
#shaper_freq_y: 0
#   输入整形器的 Y 轴频率(Hz)。通常这是希望被输入整形器消除的
#   Y 轴共振频率。对于更复杂的整形器，例如2- 和 3-hump EI 输入
#   整形器，设置这个参数可能需要考虑其他特性。
#   默认值是0，禁用 Y 轴输入整形。
#shaper_type: mzv
#   用于 X 和 Y 轴的输入整形器。支持的输入整形器有 zv、mzv、
#   zvd、ei、2hump_ei 和 3hump_ei。
#   默认为 mzv 输入整形器。
#shaper_type_x:
#shaper_type_y:
#   如果没有设置 shaper_type，可以用这两个参数来单独配置 X
#   和 Y 轴的 输入整形器。
#   该参数支持全部shaper_type 支持的选项。
#damping_ratio_x: 0.1
#damping_ratio_y: 0.1
#   X 和 Y 轴的共振抑制比例，可以用来改善振动抑制效果。
#   默认值是 0.1，适用于大多数打印机。
#   大多数情况下不需要调整这个值。
```

### [adxl345]

Support for ADXL345 accelerometers. This support allows one to query accelerometer measurements from the sensor. This enables an ACCELEROMETER_MEASURE command (see [G-Codes](G-Codes.md#adxl345) for more information). The default chip name is "default", but one may specify an explicit name (eg, [adxl345 my_chip_name]).

```
[adxl345]
cs_pin:
#   传感器的 SPI 启用引脚。
#   必须提供此参数。
#spi_speed: 5000000
#   与芯片通信时使用的SPI速度(hz)。
#   默认为5000000。
#spi_bus:
#spi_software_sclk_pin:
#spi_software_mosi_pin:
#spi_software_miso_pin:
#   参见"常见的SPI设置"章节，以了解对上述参数的描述。
#axes_map: x, y, z
#   打印机的X、Y和Z轴的加速度计轴。
#   如果加速度计的安装方向与打印机的方向不一致，
#   可能需要修改该设定。
#   例如，可以将其设置为"y, x, z"来交换X和Y轴。
#   如果加速度计方向是相反的，可能需要反转相应轴
#   （例如，"x, z, -y"）。
#   默认是"x, y, z"。
#rate: 3200
#   ADXL345的输出数据速率。ADXL345支持以下数据速率。
#   3200、1600、800、400、200、100、50和25。请注意，不建议
#   将此速率从默认的3200改为低于800的速率，这将大大影响
#   共振测量的质量。
```

### [resonance_tester]

Support for resonance testing and automatic input shaper calibration. In order to use most of the functionality of this module, additional software dependencies must be installed; refer to [Measuring Resonances](Measuring_Resonances.md) and the [command reference](G-Codes.md#resonance_tester) for more information. See the [Max smoothing](Measuring_Resonances.md#max-smoothing) section of the measuring resonances guide for more information on `max_smoothing` parameter and its use.

```
[resonance_tester]
#probe_points:
#   A list of X, Y, Z coordinates of points (one point per line) to test
#   resonances at. At least one point is required. Make sure that all
#   points with some safety margin in XY plane (~a few centimeters)
#   are reachable by the toolhead.
#accel_chip:
#   A name of the accelerometer chip to use for measurements. If
#   adxl345 chip was defined without an explicit name, this parameter
#   can simply reference it as "accel_chip: adxl345", otherwise an
#   explicit name must be supplied as well, e.g. "accel_chip: adxl345
#   my_chip_name". Either this, or the next two parameters must be
#   set.
#accel_chip_x:
#accel_chip_y:
#   Names of the accelerometer chips to use for measurements for each
#   of the axis. Can be useful, for instance, on bed slinger printer,
#   if two separate accelerometers are mounted on the bed (for Y axis)
#   and on the toolhead (for X axis). These parameters have the same
#   format as 'accel_chip' parameter. Only 'accel_chip' or these two
#   parameters must be provided.
#max_smoothing:
#   Maximum input shaper smoothing to allow for each axis during shaper
#   auto-calibration (with 'SHAPER_CALIBRATE' command). By default no
#   maximum smoothing is specified. Refer to Measuring_Resonances guide
#   for more details on using this feature.
#min_freq: 5
#   Minimum frequency to test for resonances. The default is 5 Hz.
#max_freq: 120
#   Maximum frequency to test for resonances. The default is 120 Hz.
#accel_per_hz: 75
#   This parameter is used to determine which acceleration to use to
#   test a specific frequency: accel = accel_per_hz * freq. Higher the
#   value, the higher is the energy of the oscillations. Can be set to
#   a lower than the default value if the resonances get too strong on
#   the printer. However, lower values make measurements of
#   high-frequency resonances less precise. The default value is 75
#   (mm/sec).
#hz_per_sec: 1
#   Determines the speed of the test. When testing all frequencies in
#   range [min_freq, max_freq], each second the frequency increases by
#   hz_per_sec. Small values make the test slow, and the large values
#   will decrease the precision of the test. The default value is 1.0
#   (Hz/sec == sec^-2).
```

## 配置文件助手

### [board_pins]

控制板引脚别名（可以定义任意数量的带有 "board_pins "前缀的分段）。用它来定义微控制器上的引脚的别名。

```
[board_pins my_aliases]。
mcu: mcu
#   一个可以使用别名的逗号分隔的微控制器列表。
#   默认将别名应用于主 "mcu"。
aliases:
aliases_<name>:
#   为给定的微控制器创建的一个以逗号分隔的 "name=value "
#   别名列表。例如，"EXP1_1=PE6" 将创建一个用于 "PE6 "引
#   脚的"EXP1_1 "别名。然而，如果 "值 " 被包括在 "<>"中，
#   则 "name "将被创建为一个保留针脚（例如，"EXP1_9=<GND>" 
#   将保留 "EXP1_9"）。可以指定任何数量以 "aliases_"开头的分段。
```

### [include]

引入文件支持。可以在主打印机配置文件中引用额外的配置文件。支持通配符（例如，`configs/*.cfg`）。

```
[include my_other_config.cfg]
```

### [duplicate_pin_override]

This tool allows a single micro-controller pin to be defined multiple times in a config file without normal error checking. This is intended for diagnostic and debugging purposes. This section is not needed where Klipper supports using the same pin multiple times, and using this override may cause confusing and unexpected results.

```
[duplicate_pin_override]
pins:
#   一个逗号分隔的引脚列表，允许其中的引脚在配置文件中被多次使用而不触发错误检查。
#   必须提供此参数。
```

## 打印床探测硬件

### [probe]

Z height probe. One may define this section to enable Z height probing hardware. When this section is enabled, PROBE and QUERY_PROBE extended [g-code commands](G-Codes.md#probe) become available. Also, see the [probe calibrate guide](Probe_Calibrate.md). The probe section also creates a virtual "probe:z_virtual_endstop" pin. One may set the stepper_z endstop_pin to this virtual pin on cartesian style printers that use the probe in place of a z endstop. If using "probe:z_virtual_endstop" then do not define a position_endstop in the stepper_z config section.

```
[probe]
pin:
#   Probe detection pin. If the pin is on a different microcontroller
#   than the Z steppers then it enables "multi-mcu homing". This
#   parameter must be provided.
#deactivate_on_each_sample: True
#   This determines if Klipper should execute deactivation gcode
#   between each probe attempt when performing a multiple probe
#   sequence. The default is True.
#x_offset: 0.0
#   The distance (in mm) between the probe and the nozzle along the
#   x-axis. The default is 0.
#y_offset: 0.0
#   The distance (in mm) between the probe and the nozzle along the
#   y-axis. The default is 0.
z_offset:
#   The distance (in mm) between the bed and the nozzle when the probe
#   triggers. This parameter must be provided.
#speed: 5.0
#   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when probing. The default is 5mm/s.
#samples: 1
#   The number of times to probe each point. The probed z-values will
#   be averaged. The default is to probe 1 time.
#sample_retract_dist: 2.0
#   The distance (in mm) to lift the toolhead between each sample (if
#   sampling more than once). The default is 2mm.
#lift_speed:
#   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when lifting the probe between
#   samples. The default is to use the same value as the 'speed'
#   parameter.
#samples_result: average
#   The calculation method when sampling more than once - either
#   "median" or "average". The default is average.
#samples_tolerance: 0.100
#   The maximum Z distance (in mm) that a sample may differ from other
#   samples. If this tolerance is exceeded then either an error is
#   reported or the attempt is restarted (see
#   samples_tolerance_retries). The default is 0.100mm.
#samples_tolerance_retries: 0
#   The number of times to retry if a sample is found that exceeds
#   samples_tolerance. On a retry, all current samples are discarded
#   and the probe attempt is restarted. If a valid set of samples are
#   not obtained in the given number of retries then an error is
#   reported. The default is zero which causes an error to be reported
#   on the first sample that exceeds samples_tolerance.
#activate_gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute prior to each probe attempt.
#   See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This may be
#   useful if the probe needs to be activated in some way. Do not
#   issue any commands here that move the toolhead (eg, G1). The
#   default is to not run any special G-Code commands on activation.
#deactivate_gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute after each probe attempt
#   completes. See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. Do not
#   issue any commands here that move the toolhead. The default is to
#   not run any special G-Code commands on deactivation.
```

### [bltouch]

BLTouch 探针。可以定义这个分段（而不是探针（probe）分段）来启用 BLTouch 探针。更多信息见[BL-Touch 指南](BLTouch.md)和[命令参考](G-Code.md#bltouch)。一个虚拟的 "probe:z_virtual_endstop "引脚也会被同时创建（详见 "probe "章节）。

```
[bltouch]
sensor_pin:
#   连接到 BLTouch sensor 引脚的引脚。大多数 BLTouch 需要在
#   sensor 引脚上有一个拉高电阻（在引脚名前加上“^”）。
#   必须提供这个参数。

#   等待 BLTouch探针收放的时间（以秒为单位）。
#   默认为 0.680 秒。
#stow_on_each_sample: True
#   这个参数决定了 Klipper 是否会在进行多次探测的每次探测之间
#   收放探针。在禁用这个动作前请先阅读 docs/BLTouch.md。
#   默认为True（启用）。
#probe_with_touch_mode: False
#   当该选项被启用，Klipper 会以“touch_mode”（触摸模式）使用
#   探针。
#   默认为False （禁用，使用“pin_down”模式探测）。
#pin_up_reports_not_triggered: True
#   只在 BLTouch 在 "pin_up" 命令后稳定汇报探针在一个“not triggered（未
#   触发）”的状态时需要设置。所有正版的 BLTouch 都应该设为 True（启
#   用）。 在设为False（禁用）前，请先阅读 docs/BLTouch.md 中的说明。
#   默认是True（启用）。
#pin_up_touch_mode_reports_triggered: True
#   只在 BLTouch 在 "pin_up" 和 “touch_mode" 命令后稳定汇报探针在一个“not
#    triggered（未触发）”的状态时需要设置。所有正版的 BLTouch 都应该设为 
#   True（启用）。 在设为False（禁用）前，请先阅读 docs/BLTouch.md 中的说明。
#   默认是True（启用）。
#set_output_mode:
#   向BLTouch V3.0 （和更新版本）请求一个特定的 sensor 引脚输出模式 。
#   这个设置不应该在其他类型的探针上使用。设为“5v”会请求 sensor 引脚
#   以5V输出（仅在控制板需要使用5V模式并且这个信号输入引脚可以耐受5V
#   时）。设为“OD”来请求 sensor 引脚输出使用开漏模式。
#   默认不请求输出模式。

## 额外的步进电机和挤出机

### [stepper_z1]

Multi-stepper axes. On a cartesian style printer, the stepper controlling a given axis may have additional config blocks defining steppers that should be stepped in concert with the primary stepper. One may define any number of sections with a numeric suffix starting at 1 (for example, "stepper_z1", "stepper_z2", etc.).

```
[stepper_z1]
#step_pin:
#dir_pin:
#enable_pin:
#microsteps:
#rotation_distance:
#   See the "stepper" section for the definition of the above parameters.
#endstop_pin:
#   If an endstop_pin is defined for the additional stepper then the
#   stepper will home until the endstop is triggered. Otherwise, the
#   stepper will home until the endstop on the primary stepper for the
#   axis is triggered.
```

### [extruder1]

在一个多挤出机的打印机中，为每个额外的挤出机添加一个额外挤出机分段。额外挤出机分段应被命名为"extruder1"、"extruder2"、"extruder3"，以此类推。有关可用参数，参见"extruder"章节。

See [sample-multi-extruder.cfg](../config/sample-multi-extruder.cfg) for an example configuration.

```
[extruder1]
#step_pin:
#dir_pin:
#...
#   See the "extruder" section for available stepper and heater
#   parameters.
#shared_heater:
#   This option is deprecated and should no longer be specified.
```

### [dual_carriage]

Support for cartesian printers with dual carriages on a single axis. The active carriage is set via the SET_DUAL_CARRIAGE extended g-code command. The "SET_DUAL_CARRIAGE CARRIAGE=1" command will activate the carriage defined in this section (CARRIAGE=0 will return activation to the primary carriage). Dual carriage support is typically combined with extra extruders - the SET_DUAL_CARRIAGE command is often called at the same time as the ACTIVATE_EXTRUDER command. Be sure to park the carriages during deactivation.

See [sample-idex.cfg](../config/sample-idex.cfg) for an example configuration.

```
[dual_carriage]
axis:
#   额外滑车所在的轴（x或者y）。
#   必须提供这个参数。
#step_pin:
#dir_pin:
#enable_pin:
#microsteps:
#rotation_distance:
#endstop_pin:

#position_min:
#position_max:
#   以上参数的定义请查阅“stepper”分段。
```

### [extruder_stepper]

Support for additional steppers synchronized to the movement of an extruder (one may define any number of sections with an "extruder_stepper" prefix).

See the [command reference](G-Codes.md#extruder) for more information.

```
[extruder_stepper my_extra_stepper]
#extruder: extruder
#   The extruder this stepper is synchronized to. If this is set to an
#   empty string then the stepper will not be synchronized to an
#   extruder. The default is "extruder".
#step_pin:
#dir_pin:
#enable_pin:
#microsteps:
#rotation_distance:
#   See the "stepper" section for the definition of the above
#   parameters.
```

### [manual_stepper]

Manual steppers (one may define any number of sections with a "manual_stepper" prefix). These are steppers that are controlled by the MANUAL_STEPPER g-code command. For example: "MANUAL_STEPPER STEPPER=my_stepper MOVE=10 SPEED=5". See [G-Codes](G-Codes.md#manual_stepper) file for a description of the MANUAL_STEPPER command. The steppers are not connected to the normal printer kinematics.

```
[manual_stepper my_stepper]。
#step_pin:
#dir_pin:
#enable_pin:
#microsteps:
#rotation_distance:
#   有关这些参数的描述请见"stepper"分段。
#velocity:
#   设置步进电机的默认速度（单位：mm/s）。这个值会在 MANUAL_STEPPER
#   命令没有指定一个 SPEED 参数时会被使用。
#   默认为 5 mm/s。
#accel:
#   设置步进电机的默认加速度（单位：mm/s^2）。设置加速度为零将导致
#   没有加速度。这个值会在 MANUAL_STEPPER 命令没有指定 ACCEL 参数时
#   会被使用。
#   默认为 0。
#endstop_pin:
#   限位开关检测引脚。如果定义了这个参数，可以通过在 MANUAL_STEPPER
#   运动命令中添加一个 STOP_ON_ENDSTOP 参数来执行 "归位动作" 。
```

## 自定义加热器和传感器

### [verify_heater]

加热器和温度传感器验证。默认在打印机上每个配置的加热器上启用加热器验证。使用 verify_heater 分段来覆盖默认设置。

```
[verify_heater heater_config_name]
#max_error: 120
#   The maximum "cumulative temperature error" before raising an
#   error. Smaller values result in stricter checking and larger
#   values allow for more time before an error is reported.
#   Specifically, the temperature is inspected once a second and if it
#   is close to the target temperature then an internal "error
#   counter" is reset; otherwise, if the temperature is below the
#   target range then the counter is increased by the amount the
#   reported temperature differs from that range. Should the counter
#   exceed this "max_error" then an error is raised. The default is
#   120.
#check_gain_time:
#   This controls heater verification during initial heating. Smaller
#   values result in stricter checking and larger values allow for
#   more time before an error is reported. Specifically, during
#   initial heating, as long as the heater increases in temperature
#   within this time frame (specified in seconds) then the internal
#   "error counter" is reset. The default is 20 seconds for extruders
#   and 60 seconds for heater_bed.
#hysteresis: 5
#   The maximum temperature difference (in Celsius) to a target
#   temperature that is considered in range of the target. This
#   controls the max_error range check. It is rare to customize this
#   value. The default is 5.
#heating_gain: 2
#   The minimum temperature (in Celsius) that the heater must increase
#   by during the check_gain_time check. It is rare to customize this
#   value. The default is 2.
```

### [homing_heaters]

Tool to disable heaters when homing or probing an axis.

```
[homing_heaters]
#steppers:
#   会使加热器被禁用的步进电机逗号分隔列表。
#   默认在归零和探测时禁用全部加热器。
#   例如：stepper_z
#heaters:
#   归零和探测时会被禁用的加热器的逗号分隔列表。
#   默认禁用全部加热器。
#   例如：extruder, heater_bed
```

### [thermistor]

自定义热敏电阻（可以定义任意数量的带有“热敏电阻”前缀的分段）。可以在加热器配置分段的 sensor_type 字段中使用自定义热敏电阻。 （例如，如果定义了“[thermistor my_thermistor]”分段，那么在定义加热器时可以使用“sensor_type: my_thermistor”。）确保将热敏电阻分段放在配置文件中第一次使用这个传感器的加热器分段的上方。

```
[thermistor my_thermistor]
#temperature1:
#resistance1:
#temperature2:
#resistance2:
#temperature3:
#resistance3:
#   Three resistance measurements (in Ohms) at the given temperatures
#   (in Celsius). The three measurements will be used to calculate the
#   Steinhart-Hart coefficients for the thermistor. These parameters
#   must be provided when using Steinhart-Hart to define the
#   thermistor.
#beta:
#   Alternatively, one may define temperature1, resistance1, and beta
#   to define the thermistor parameters. This parameter must be
#   provided when using "beta" to define the thermistor.
```

### [adc_temperature]

自定义 ADC 温度传感器（可以使用 “adc_temperature” 前缀定义任意数量的分段）。这允许定义一个自定义温度传感器，该传感器测量一个模数转换器 (ADC) 引脚上的电压，并在一组配置的温度/电压（或温度/电阻）测量值之间使用线性插值来确定温度。设置的传感器可被用作加热器分段中的 sensor_type。 （例如，如果定义了 “[adc_temperature my_sensor]” 分段，则在定义加热器时可以使用 “sensor_type: my_sensor” 。）确保将传感器分段放在配置文件中第一次使用这个传感器的加热器分段的上方。

```
[adc_temperature my_sensor]
#temperature1:
#voltage1:
#temperature2:
#voltage2:
#...
#   一组用作温度转换的参考温度（以摄氏度为单位）和电压（以
#   伏特为单位）。使用这个传感器的加热器分段也可以指定
#   adc_voltage 和 voltage_offset 参数来定义 ADC 电压（详见“常用温度
#   放大器”章节）。至少要提供两个测量点。
#temperature1:
#resistance1:
#temperature2:
#resistance2:
#...
#   作为替代，也可以指定一组用作温度转换的参考温度（以摄氏度为
#   单位）和阻值（以欧姆为单位）。使用这个传感器的加热器分段也
#   可以指定一个 pullup_resistor 参数（详见“挤出机”章节）。至少要
#   提供两个测量点。
```

### [heater_generic]

Generic heaters (one may define any number of sections with a "heater_generic" prefix). These heaters behave similarly to standard heaters (extruders, heated beds). Use the SET_HEATER_TEMPERATURE command (see [G-Codes](G-Codes.md#heaters) for details) to set the target temperature.

```
[heater_generic my_generic_heater]
#gcode_id:
#   使用M105查询温度时使用的ID。

```
[temperature_sensor my_sensor]
#sensor_type:
#sensor_pin:
#min_temp:
#max_temp:
#   See the "extruder" section for the definition of the above
#   parameters.
#gcode_id:
#   See the "heater_generic" section for the definition of this
#   parameter.
```

## Temperature sensors

Klipper 包括许多类型的温度传感器的定义。这些传感器可以在任何需要温度传感器的配置分段中使用（例如`[extruder]`或`[heated_bed]`分段）。

### 常见热敏电阻

#sensor_mcu: mcu
#   The micro-controller to read from. The default is "mcu".
#sensor_temperature1:
#sensor_adc1:
#   Specify the above two parameters (a temperature in Celsius and an
#   ADC value as a float between 0.0 and 1.0) to calibrate the
#   micro-controller temperature. This may improve the reported
#   temperature accuracy on some chips. A typical way to obtain this
#   calibration information is to completely remove power from the
#   printer for a few hours (to ensure it is at the ambient
#   temperature), then power it up and use the QUERY_ADC command to
#   obtain an ADC measurement. Use some other temperature sensor on
#   the printer to find the corresponding ambient temperature. The
#   default is to use the factory calibration data on the
#   micro-controller (if applicable) or the nominal values from the
#   micro-controller specification.
#sensor_temperature2:
#sensor_adc2:
#   If sensor_temperature1/sensor_adc1 is specified then one may also
#   specify sensor_temperature2/sensor_adc2 calibration data. Doing so
#   may provide calibrated "temperature slope" information. The
#   default is to use the factory calibration data on the
#   micro-controller (if applicable) or the nominal values from the
#   micro-controller specification.
```

## 风扇

### [fan]

打印冷却风扇。

```
[fan]
pin:
#   控制风扇的输出引脚。
#   必须提供此参数。
#max_power: 1.0
#   引脚允许被设置的最大占空比（在0.0和1.0之间）。
#   1.0 允许引脚被长时间完全启用，而0.5会只允许引脚只在一半的时间里
#   被启用。这个设置可以限制风扇的最大功率（平均功率）。如果这个值
#   小于 1.0 则风速请求会被缩放到 0 和 max_power 之间（例如，如果
#   max_power 是 0.9，请求 80% 风速速度会使风扇功率设为72%）。
#   默认为1.0。
#shutdown_speed: 0
#   在微控制器进入错误状态时期望的（一个在0.0和1.0之间的值）
#   风扇速度。
#   默认为 0。
#cycle_time: 0.010
#   The amount of time (in seconds) for each PWM power cycle to the
#   fan. It is recommended this be 10 milliseconds or greater when
#   using software based PWM. The default is 0.010 seconds.
#hardware_pwm: False
#   Enable this to use hardware PWM instead of software PWM. Most fans
#   do not work well with hardware PWM, so it is not recommended to
#   enable this unless there is an electrical requirement to switch at
#   very high speeds. When using hardware PWM the actual cycle time is
#   constrained by the implementation and may be significantly
#   different than the requested cycle_time. The default is False.
#kick_start_time: 0.100
#   Time (in seconds) to run the fan at full speed when either first
#   enabling or increasing it by more than 50% (helps get the fan
#   spinning). The default is 0.100 seconds.
#off_below: 0.0
#   The minimum input speed which will power the fan (expressed as a
#   value from 0.0 to 1.0). When a speed lower than off_below is
#   requested the fan will instead be turned off. This setting may be
#   used to prevent fan stalls and to ensure kick starts are
#   effective. The default is 0.0.
#
#   This setting should be recalibrated whenever max_power is adjusted.
#   To calibrate this setting, start with off_below set to 0.0 and the
#   fan spinning. Gradually lower the fan speed to determine the lowest
#   input speed which reliably drives the fan without stalls. Set
#   off_below to the duty cycle corresponding to this value (for
#   example, 12% -> 0.12) or slightly higher.
#tachometer_pin:
#   Tachometer input pin for monitoring fan speed. A pullup is generally
#   required. This parameter is optional.
#tachometer_ppr: 2
#   When tachometer_pin is specified, this is the number of pulses per
#   revolution of the tachometer signal. For a BLDC fan this is
#   normally half the number of poles. The default is 2.
#tachometer_poll_interval: 0.0015
#   When tachometer_pin is specified, this is the polling period of the
#   tachometer pin, in seconds. The default is 0.0015, which is fast
#   enough for fans below 10000 RPM at 2 PPR. This must be smaller than
#   30/(tachometer_ppr*rpm), with some margin, where rpm is the
#   maximum speed (in RPM) of the fan.
```

### [heater_fan]

#heater_temp: 50.0
#   风扇可以被禁用的最高加热器温度（以摄氏度为单位）。加热器
#   必须被降低到该温度以下风扇才会被禁用。
#   默认为 50 摄氏度。
#fan_speed: 1.0
#   当相关联的加热器活跃时该风扇的速度（在0.0和1.0之间）。
#   默认为 1.0
```

#   的数值表示）。
#   默认为 1.0。

#   在步进电机或加热器不再活跃后风扇持续运行的时间（以秒
#   为单位）。
#   默认为 30秒。
#idle_speed:

#   idle_timeout)时的风扇速度（以一个0.0到1.0的数值表示）。
#   默认为 fan_speed。
#heater:
#stepper:
#   与这个风扇关联的加热器/步进驱动配置分段名称。如果提
#   供一个逗号分隔的加热器/步进驱动名称，任意一个列表中
#   的设备启用时风扇将会启动。
#   默认加热器是“挤出机”（extruder)，默认步进驱动是全部步进驱动。

```
[output_pin my_pin]
pin:
#   The pin to configure as an output. This parameter must be
#   provided.
#pwm: False
#   Set if the output pin should be capable of pulse-width-modulation.
#   If this is true, the value fields should be between 0 and 1; if it
#   is false the value fields should be either 0 or 1. The default is
#   False.
#static_value:
#   If this is set, then the pin is assigned to this value at startup
#   and the pin can not be changed during runtime. A static pin uses
#   slightly less ram in the micro-controller. The default is to use
#   runtime configuration of pins.
#value:
#   The value to initially set the pin to during MCU configuration.
#   The default is 0 (for low voltage).
#shutdown_value:
#   The value to set the pin to on an MCU shutdown event. The default
#   is 0 (for low voltage).
#maximum_mcu_duration:
#   The maximum duration a non-shutdown value may be driven by the MCU
#   without an acknowledge from the host.
#   If host can not keep up with an update, the MCU will shutdown
#   and set all pins to their respective shutdown values.
#   Default: 0 (disabled)
#   Usual values are around 5 seconds.
#cycle_time: 0.100
#   The amount of time (in seconds) per PWM cycle. It is recommended
#   this be 10 milliseconds or greater when using software based PWM.
#   The default is 0.100 seconds for pwm pins.
#hardware_pwm: False
#   Enable this to use hardware PWM instead of software PWM. When
#   using hardware PWM the actual cycle time is constrained by the
#   implementation and may be significantly different than the
#   requested cycle_time. The default is False.
#scale:
#   This parameter can be used to alter how the 'value' and
#   'shutdown_value' parameters are interpreted for pwm pins. If
#   provided, then the 'value' parameter should be between 0.0 and
#   'scale'. This may be useful when configuring a PWM pin that
#   controls a stepper voltage reference. The 'scale' can be set to
#   the equivalent stepper amperage if the PWM were fully enabled, and
#   then the 'value' parameter can be specified using the desired
#   amperage for the stepper. The default is to not scale the 'value'
#   parameter.
```

### [static_digital_output]

Statically configured digital output pins (one may define any number of sections with a "static_digital_output" prefix). Pins configured here will be setup as a GPIO output during MCU configuration. They can not be changed at run-time.

#   with "!". This parameter must be provided.
```

### [multi_pin]

Multiple pin outputs (one may define any number of sections with a "multi_pin" prefix). A multi_pin output creates an internal pin alias that can modify multiple output pins each time the alias pin is set. For example, one could define a "[multi_pin my_fan]" object containing two pins and then set "pin=multi_pin:my_fan" in the "[fan]" section - on each fan change both output pins would be updated. These aliases may not be used with stepper motor pins.

pins:
#   与此别名关联的引脚的逗号分隔列表。
#   必须提供此参数。

#   Position 1 corresponds to the stepper that connects to the MOSI signal.
#   The default is to not use an SPI daisy chain.
#interpolate: True
#   If true, enable step interpolation (the driver will internally
#   step at a rate of 256 micro-steps). This interpolation does
#   introduce a small systemic positional deviation - see
#   TMC_Drivers.md for details. The default is True.
run_current:
#   The amount of current (in amps RMS) to configure the driver to use

run_current:
#   The amount of current (in amps RMS) used by the driver during
#   stepper movement. This parameter must be provided.
#sense_resistor:

#idle_current_percent: 100
#   The percentage of the run_current the stepper driver will be

#   be raised again once the stepper has to move again. Make sure to
#   set this to a high enough value such that the steppers do not lose

#   关联到给定的值（被解析为Python literal）并在macro解释时可
#   以被使用。如果参数被render()的调用传入，则这个值会被用于
#   宏扩展。例如，配置 "param_speed = 75" 允许调用
#   "render('my_template_name', param_speed=80)"。
#   参数名不能包含大写字符。
#text:
#   当 render() 函数因为这个模板被调用时会显示的文本。这个
#   字段使用命令模板（请见docs/Command_Templates.md）。
#   必须提供此参数。
